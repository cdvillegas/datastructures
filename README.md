# datastructures
A repository containing a collection of common data structures implemented in Python, along with a corresponding set of unit tests to verify their correctness. The repository is divided into two main modules: the *datastructures* module, containing the actual implementations, and the *tests* module, containing the test cases.

## Running Tests
Tests can be run from the terminal using the following command:
```
python3 -m unittest tests/test_name.py
```
You can also run all tests at once using the discover feature of unittest:
```
python3 -m unittest discover tests
```
This will automatically discover and run all test cases in the tests directory.

## Contribution
Feel free to contribute to the repository by adding more data structures or enhancing the existing ones. Be sure to include corresponding tests to verify the implementation.
